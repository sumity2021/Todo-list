# Todo List Application

This Todo List application is a simple, interactive tool for managing tasks. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them when no longer needed. The application is built using React, with a focus on clean design and user-friendly functionality.

## Features

### 1. **Add New Tasks**
   - Users can add new tasks by entering text into the input field and clicking the "ADD +" button.
   - The task is then displayed in the list below with an option to mark it as complete or delete it.

### 2. **Mark Tasks as Complete**
   - Each task can be marked as complete by clicking on the task or the tick icon next to it.
   - When a task is marked as complete, its text will have a line-through effect, and the tick icon changes to indicate completion.

### 3. **Delete Tasks**
   - Users can delete tasks by clicking the delete (trash) icon next to each task.
   - Once a task is deleted, it is removed from the list and no longer displayed.

### 4. **Responsive Design**
   - The application is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes for an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
